# Syncing Docker Containers and Folders: A Seamless Connection

This repository contains detailed step-by-step instructions for setting up a seamless sync between Docker containers and local folders. Whether you're a developer looking to streamline your workflow or a system administrator managing containerized applications, this guide provides code snippets and commands for an efficient setup.

## Docker Volume Setup

### Launch a Docker Server with Ubuntu OS and Docker Installed

```bash
# Assuming you have Ubuntu OS installed, install Docker
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y docker.io
Create a "developer" Directory
bash
Copy code
# Create a directory named "developer"
mkdir ~/developer
Launch a Docker Container with Volume Mounting
bash
Copy code
# Launch a Docker container with volume mounting
docker run -itd --name developeraccess -p "8010:80" -v "/root/developer:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs" httpd
Folder Sync (1.1 SYNC)
To avoid direct access to the container, we create a folder on the Docker server and enable synchronization between the container and the Docker server.

bash
Copy code
# Create a "developer" folder on the Docker server for synchronization
cd ~
mkdir developer
bash
Copy code
# Launch a Docker container with volume mounting for synchronization
docker run -itd --name developeraccess -p "8010:80" -v "/root/developer:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs" httpd
Container Configuration
Access the Container
bash
Copy code
# Log in to the container
docker exec -it developeraccess /bin/bash
bash
Copy code
# Navigate to the htdocs directory (if there's no index file)
cd htdocs/
Inside the Container
bash
Copy code
# Update package information
apt-get update

# Install Vim text editor (or use any other editor of your choice)
apt-get install -y vim
bash
Copy code
# Edit the index.html file
vi index.html
# Or, you can use echo to create a simple index.html
echo "This is docker session 3" > index.html
bash
Copy code
# View the contents of index.html
cat index.html
bash
Copy code
# Exit the container
exit
Check the synchronization in the Docker server and make changes in the Docker server, then check inside the container for synchronization.
